# Receive Emails with SendGrid (Inbound Parse)

## Overview

SendGrid's **Inbound Parse Webhook** receives emails for a specific hostname/subdomain, parses the message, and POSTs it to your webhook as `multipart/form-data`.

**Key differences vs Resend:**
- SendGrid **posts the full parsed email** (text/html/headers/attachments) directly to your webhook.
- There is **no official signature verification** for Inbound Parse (unlike SendGrid Event Webhook). You must secure the endpoint yourself.

## Quick Start

### Verify Your Setup First
```bash
# Check MX record and test webhook
../scripts/verify-inbound-setup.sh parse.example.com https://webhook.example.com/parse
```

**Then configure:**

1. **Create MX record** pointing to `mx.sendgrid.net` for a dedicated hostname (recommended: subdomain).
2. **Configure Inbound Parse** in SendGrid Console with a receiving domain + destination URL.
3. **Handle the webhook**: parse `multipart/form-data`, read `text`, `html`, `headers`, and attachments.
4. **Secure the endpoint** (basic auth, allowlists, size limits).

### Parse Webhook Payloads
```bash
# Debug or test payload parsing
node ../scripts/parse-webhook-payload.js < payload.txt
```

## DNS / MX Setup

Create an MX record for a dedicated hostname:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Type** | MX |
| **Host** | `parse` (or another subdomain) |
| **Priority** | 10 |
| **Value** | `mx.sendgrid.net` |

**Recommendation:** Use a subdomain to avoid disrupting existing email providers (e.g., `parse.example.com`).

## Inbound Parse Configuration

In SendGrid Console:

- **Settings → Inbound Parse**
- Add **Receiving Domain** and **Destination URL**
- Example receiving address: `anything@parse.example.com`

## Webhook Payload (Multipart/Form-Data)

SendGrid posts data like:

- `from`, `to`, `cc`, `subject`
- `text`, `html`
- `headers` (raw email headers)
- `envelope` (JSON with SMTP envelope data)
- `attachments` (count)
- `attachmentX` (file content; filename in part)

**Example fields** (varies by config):
```
from: "Alice <alice@example.com>"
to: "support@parse.example.com"
subject: "Help"
text: "Plain text body"
html: "<p>HTML body</p>"
headers: "...raw headers..."
envelope: {"to":["support@parse.example.com"],"from":"alice@example.com"}
attachments: 2
attachment1: <file>
attachment2: <file>
```

## Decision: How to Secure Inbound Parse Webhook?

```
Security requirements?
├─ Public endpoint (internet-facing)
│  └─ Basic auth + IP allowlist + size limits + content validation
├─ Internal only (VPN/private network)
│  └─ Network ACL + basic auth
└─ High security (PCI/HIPAA)
   └─ mTLS + custom signature verification + request logging
```

**Minimum security (public endpoints):**
- Basic authentication on webhook URL
- IP allowlist (SendGrid IP ranges)
- Request size limits (10-25 MB)
- Content-type validation (`multipart/form-data`)

**Additional hardening:**
- Rate limiting per sender
- Spam filtering / sender validation
- HTML sanitization before storage
- Attachment virus scanning

## Security Best Practices

Because Inbound Parse has **no signature verification**, treat inbound data as untrusted:

- **Require basic auth** on the webhook URL.
- **Allowlist sender domains** if appropriate.
- **Limit request size** (e.g., 10–25 MB) to avoid abuse.
- **Validate content-type** (`multipart/form-data`).
- **Do not execute or render HTML** without sanitization.
- **Protect against prompt injection** if forwarding to AI systems.

## Troubleshooting

**MX record not resolving:**
- DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours
- Verify MX record with `dig parse.example.com MX` or `nslookup -type=MX parse.example.com`
- Check for typos in hostname or value

**Webhook not receiving emails:**
- Verify webhook URL is publicly accessible (test with curl)
- Check firewall rules / security groups
- Ensure endpoint returns 200 OK response
- Check SendGrid Inbound Parse logs in console

**Payload parsing errors:**
- Verify you're handling `multipart/form-data` correctly
- Use a multipart parser library (e.g., `multer` for Node.js)
- Log raw request body for debugging

**Attachments too large:**
- Configure web server size limits (nginx: `client_max_body_size`)
- Application size limits (Express: `limit` in body-parser)
- SendGrid default max is 30 MB per email

**Unauthorized webhook access:**
- Add basic authentication to webhook URL
- Allowlist SendGrid IP ranges (see SendGrid docs)
- Use HTTPS only
- Monitor for suspicious activity
